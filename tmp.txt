[x] on keyboard nav:
* popup now gets hidden at bottom, when it reaches the end of list item in the feed
* when hitting escape when emoji menu is open, focus goes back to button, which is great! But this doesn't happen when hitting enter/space to select, please fix
* when lightbox is open and reactions menu is open, escape should close menu, but instead it closes photo
[x] rather than the selected reaction having a white border, very similar to the focus appearance, can you just change the background colour? e.g. like we do with theme dropdown
[x] when you tab out of the theme or group pickers, they close - this doesn't happen for reaction popup
[x] This wasn't fixed:
* when lightbox is open and reactions menu is open, escape should close menu, but instead it closes photo

[ ] weird bug - changing reaction with comments open just clears comments, i.e. it says "No comments yet" even though there are some. Closing and reopening lightbox shows them again

[ ] cache comments/reactions

[ ] allow sorting of comments by newest or oldest, default to newest (i.e. newest at top)

[ ] hover and click both work, for both adding reaction and viewing other's reactions in both photo feed and lightbox

[ ] comments take up fixed height: I don't like it jumping up and down when scrolling between photos where some have few comments and others many

[ ] deleting comment closes lightbox
